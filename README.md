> What is AI?
In a way, AI is the simuation of human intelligence. How humans think and take decisions. Human brain is comprised of Neurons that trigger an impulse. Artificial Neural Networks created by Geoffrey Hinton behave in a similar fashion. Now training and self learning is an important part of it. The series of projects here will try to use them in multi-disciplinary areas in order to make every system smarter and better.
